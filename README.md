# CEmu [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MateoConLechuga/CEmu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MateoConLechuga/CEmu) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ou1kj8xox1vmkdi4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/alberthdev/cemu)
CEmu is an open-source third-party TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculator emulator.  

With a core made in C and GUI in C++ with Qt, it works natively on many platforms. It has even been succesfully tested on web-browsers (JavaScript via Emscripten), the TI-Nspire CX (Ndless SDK), and the Apple Watch.

Here's what it looks like on Mac OS X:

## Downloads
No stable binaries yet as the code keeps changing these days! When available, they'll be here, though: https://github.com/MateoConLechuga/CEmu/releases

## How to build
After downloading the source (you can clone the repo or just get the zip):

1. Get the [latest Qt5 SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-3) for your OS.
  * On Windows, if you are building with Visual Studio, you must use
    Visual Studio 2015 or newer. You also must download a Qt build that
    is compatible with Visual Studio 2015 or newer.
    * If you don't have Visual Studio 2015 installed, we recommend
      installing [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409).
    * Qt v5.6 is the only version of Qt (at the moment) that supports
      VS2015.
      * You can download the beta version of Qt v5.6
        [here](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/).
      * Direct download links for Qt v5.6 (VS2015):
        [MSVC 2015 x86](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015-5.6.0-beta.exe)
        and [MSVC 2015 x64](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015_64-5.6.0-beta.exe)
    * Note that the latest Qt v5.6 beta has a bug where the version of
      MSVC is incorrect. (It is displayed as 2013 or older.) This is
      simply a display bug. To ensure that you are using MSVC 2015,
      check the actual compiler version and ensure that it is 14.0
      or newer.
    
2. Now you have two options:
  * Open the .pro file with Qt Creator, set it up (default project settings should be fine), and hit Build
  * In a shell, cd to the project folder and type `qmake -r CEmu.pro; make`

You're welcome to [report any bugs](https://github.com/MateoConLechuga/CEmu/issues) you may encounter, and if you want to help, tell us, or send patches / pull requests!


## TODO list
### Core
* Implement unknown port range (0xDXXX)
* Implement USB (0xDXXX appears to be a part of this as well)
* Add more flash handlers
* other bug fixes
* ...

### Overall features
* More robust and complete variable transfer (Calc <-> Computer)
* Emulation speed setting
* ...

### GUI
* Window for configuring keybindings
* HD Icon
* Fix single GIF frame output
* Plan for 83PCE / 84+CE differences (2 keypad setups, "skins", etc.)
* More translations (for now, it's available in English and French).
* ...

## In the future...
* Make a web-based version of CEmu, like there’s a web-based version of z80e for trying out KnightOS. _Compiling the CEmu core to JavaScript (and later WebAssembly), using Emscripten, is already known to work_
* Think about CEmu's core’s integration on third-party projects, like TI-Planet's Project Builder - for instance, in C projects, in order to directly test the program, and eventually have live source-level debugging!
* Look at [this gdb-z80](https://github.com/legumbre/gdb-z80) project (code from 2011...) ; try to see if it can be updated for eZ80, and used with a CEmu GDB stub. Mainlining such code is highly preferable.
