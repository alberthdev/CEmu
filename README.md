# CEmu [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MateoConLechuga/CEmu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MateoConLechuga/CEmu) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ou1kj8xox1vmkdi4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/alberthdev/cemu) [![Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/7576/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/mateoconlechuga-cemu)

CEmu is an open-source third-party TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculator emulator.  

CEmu has a customizable user interface to fit the needs of different types of users, like typical students, teachers (who will like the resizable, detached display), developers (who will enjoy the various debugging features)...  
Here are three setup examples of CEmu running on Mac OS X:

Standard  | Teacher-oriented | Developer-oriented
------------ | ------------- | -------------

With a core made in C and GUI in C++ with Qt, it works natively on many platforms.  
In fact, the core has even been succesfully tested on web-browsers (JavaScript via Emscripten), the TI-Nspire CX (Ndless SDK), and the Apple Watch.

## Downloads
No stable binaries yet as the code keeps changing these days! When available, they'll be here, though: https://github.com/MateoConLechuga/CEmu/releases  
Nightly win32 binaries available here (hosted by pimathbrainiac): http://pimathbrainiac.me/CEmu/

## How to build
After downloading the source (you can clone the repo or just get the zip):

1. Get the [latest Qt5 SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-3) for your OS.
  * On Windows, if you are building with Visual Studio, you must use
    Visual Studio 2015 or newer. You also must download a Qt build that
    is compatible with Visual Studio 2015 or newer.
    * If you don't have Visual Studio 2015 installed, we recommend
      installing [Visual Studio 2015 Community](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409).
    * Qt v5.6 is the only version of Qt (at the moment) that supports
      VS2015.
      * You can download the beta version of Qt v5.6
        [here](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/).
      * Direct download links for Qt v5.6 (VS2015):
        [MSVC 2015 x86](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015-5.6.0-beta.exe)
        and [MSVC 2015 x64](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.0-beta/qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2015_64-5.6.0-beta.exe)
    * Note that the latest Qt v5.6 beta has a bug where the version of
      MSVC is incorrect. (It is displayed as 2013 or older.) This is
      simply a display bug. To ensure that you are using MSVC 2015,
      check the actual compiler version and ensure that it is 14.0
      or newer.
    
2. Now you have two options:
  * Open the .pro file with Qt Creator, set it up (default project settings should be fine), and hit Build
  * In a shell, cd to the project folder and type `qmake -r CEmu.pro; make`

_Note: Debugging support is somewhat core-related but is only built conditionally (since embedded targets probably won't need it). To enable it, define `DEBUG_SUPPORT`. The Qt GUI does this in the .pro file._

You're welcome to [report any bugs](https://github.com/MateoConLechuga/CEmu/issues) you may encounter, and if you want to help, tell us, or send patches / pull requests! If you'd like to contribute code, please consider using [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) with the settings specified in the `.astylerc` file to format your code. Qt Creator can [format code with Artistic Style](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html) with minimal setup.


## TODO list
### Core
* Implement unknown port range (0xDXXX)
* Implement USB (0xDXXX appears to be a part of this as well)
* Add more flash handlers
* Fix known bugs
* ...

### Overall features
* More robust and complete variable transfer (Calc <-> Computer)
* ...

### GUI
* Implement 83PCE/84+CE differences (2 keypad setups, "skins", etc.)
* More translations (for now, it's available in English, French, and Spanish).
* ...

## In the future...
* Make a web-based version of CEmu, like there’s a web-based version of z80e for trying out KnightOS. _Compiling the CEmu core to JavaScript (and later WebAssembly), using Emscripten, is already known to work_
* Think about CEmu's core’s integration on third-party projects, like TI-Planet's Project Builder - for instance, in C projects, in order to directly test the program, and eventually have live source-level debugging!
* Look at [this gdb-z80](https://github.com/legumbre/gdb-z80) project (code from 2011...) ; try to see if it can be updated for eZ80, and used with a CEmu GDB stub. Mainlining such code is highly preferable.
